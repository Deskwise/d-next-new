Here’s a clean site structure that centers the “two kinds of ghost work,” adds ThinkWise™, and keeps things aspirational (identity + outcomes). No copy yet—just page names, roles, and flow.

Primary navigation (top bar)

Home — From Busy to Big
Role: Landing + quick proof. Anchors: Hero • We Remove / We Enable (two-column, ordered by value) • Method (Listen → Diagnose → Prove → Automate → Scale) • Mini proof • CTAs.

ThinkWise™
Role: Your reasoning layer: “question behind the question” → McKinsey-level Executive Briefs from Excel/PDF/notes. (This replaces “docs” narratives with thinking.)

The Invisible Engine
Role: How the quiet automations keep wins alive (background research pulls, follow-through nudges, daily briefs). Light privacy/trust note here.

Orchestrations
Role: Real playbooks grid (Campaign Lift-Off, Lead Finder & Enricher, Numbers→Story, PDF→Decision, Morning Ops Brief, SOP in an Afternoon, Market X-Ray (educational)). Each card: outcome, proof shape, tiny next step.

Plans & Pricing — Momentum Plans
Role: Good / Better / Best + accelerators (Friction X-Ray, Proof Sprint). Stripe CTAs.

Proof
Role: Before/after gallery + 1–2 quotes. Social proof lives here (not scattered).

Book Friction X-Ray
Role: Dedicated conversion page with guarantee. Primary CTA across site points here.

Secondary nav (menu or footer)

Why Invisible Work
Role: Name the enemy (drag) + promise (engine). Two kinds of ghost work explained.

Proof Sprint (48h)
Role: Offer detail page (what’s included, examples, CTA).

Security & Privacy
Role: Data handling, NDA, scope boundaries (e.g., not legal advice).

Integrations
Role: Logos + categories (CRM, docs, spreadsheets, chat, storage). Light, credible.

FAQs
Role: Central answers (guarantee, reversibility, rollovers, Market X-Ray disclaimer).

Contact
Role: Simple contact + calendar link (fallback to Book X-Ray).

Field Notes (optional)
Role: Short, useful posts—“Before/After” breakdowns and insights (authority + SEO).

Home page section order (recommended)

Hero: “From Busy to Big” + identity-aspirational subhead + dual CTAs (Book X-Ray / See 60-sec Brief).

We Remove / We Enable (two-column, ordered by executive value):

Remove: unclear briefs & meeting churn; Excel swamp; 50-page PDF sludge; manual copy-paste; scattered updates; social whiplash; lead janitoring; last-minute rewrites; who’s-on-first chaos; (opt) market FOMO.

Enable: Executive Brief in 60s (ThinkWise™); ThinkWise™ Numbers Brief; Decision Table; Drafts-not-surprises; Morning Ops Brief; Campaign Lift-Off; Lead Finder & Enricher; Stakeholder-ready polish; Follow-through nudges; Market X-Ray (educational).

ThinkWise™ teaser: “question behind the question” → Executive Brief → options + default → proof.

Method: Listen → Diagnose → Prove → Automate → Scale (one-line each).

Orchestrations carousel: 5–6 cards with outcomes (not features).

Mini proof: 2–3 before/after tiles.

Plans & Guarantees teaser: Good/Better/Best snapshot + “no five-figure lever, no fee.”

Final CTA: Book Friction X-Ray.

CTA routing (consistent, Cialdini-aligned)

Primary CTA (always): Book Friction X-Ray (Commitment + Protection).

Secondary CTA: See 60-sec Executive Brief (Reciprocity).

Mid-page CTAs: Request Proof Sprint, Explore Plans.

Scarcity: “Limited Proof Sprint windows weekly” on Orchestrations + Proof Sprint page.

Identity hook (use across pages)

“Imagine who you become when the drag is gone and the engine is on.”
(Elite team-of-one • decisive operator • closer with proof • builder who launches this week • calm leader with one-page updates • strategist who turns numbers into a lever.)

What to keep / what to drop from current site

Keep: Testimonials, Integrations, FAQs, pricing logic, “donate 2%” note.

Refit: “Why We’re Different” → Why Invisible Work; “Method” → The Invisible Engine + ThinkWise™.

Drop from Home: code snippets, overly generic features grid; move technicals to “Invisible Engine.”

Rename CTAs: “Book a Free Call” → Book Friction X-Ray.
