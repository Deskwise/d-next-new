Behavior rules loaded ✓ - TDD mode active

Operating rules:
- Use the TDD workflow (test first → confirm → code → verify).
- Perform mandatory pre‑flight checks (scope, paths, success criteria, constraints) before changes.
- Stop and ask if certainty < 90%.
- Avoid forbidden actions without explicit permission (new projects, deps, architecture changes, etc.).

Verification note:
On activation, briefly summarize how you will verify work outputs and how the user can check success.
