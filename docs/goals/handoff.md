## CURRENT STATUS: 5 of 8 tasks complete
**WORKING PROJECT LOCATION**: `/home/richard/code/d-next-new/`

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:
6. [pending] Implement Motion.dev animations matching current site behavior  
7. [pending] Rebrand all content from Deskwise to Archy throughout the site
8. [pending] Test and optimize for Core Web Vitals performance requirements

## QUICK START:
```bash
cd /home/richard/code/d-next-new
npm run dev  # Should work - all components built
```

```bash
# Tests are in the OLD location but test the NEW project
cd /home/richard/code/d-next
npx jest tests/06-motion-animations.test.js  # etc
```

## KEY FILES YOU NEED:
