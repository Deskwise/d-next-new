Why Ghost Work Costs You

Heading: Ghost work drains productivity and limits growth

Paragraph: Every business is haunted by repetitive tasks, scattered documents and stalled decisions. These hidden chores consume your time and budget, leaving little space for strategy or innovation. Deskwise removes this drag by handling the invisible work so you can focus on what moves the needle.

Key Benefit Bullets:

Immediate relief: reclaim hours in week one

Enablement: one person performs like an elite team

Proof‑first: reversible steps with measurable before/after results

Drafts, not surprises: fast, visible iterations

Mini Testimonial:

“Within days we saw our team spending more time on strategy instead of wrangling docs. Deskwise is like adding a silent operations crew.” — C. Martinez, Founder, Colorado Springs

How Deskwise Works

Heading: A pipeline built for results

Intro Paragraph: Deskwise takes you from question to proof in days. Our structured, five‑phase ThinkWise pipeline and our Invisible Engine ensure every action is validated, reversible and grounded in measurable results.

Five Phases with Icons:

Listen – Capture your goal and constraints in a one‑page brief.

Diagnose – Explore options, list risks, provide a recommended default.

Prove – Deliver a proof‑of‑concept with before/after impact.

Validate – Expert committees (Market, Product, Data, Engineering, Legal) sign off. Notes appear in your Boardroom.

Scale – Turn proofs into reliable automations and repeat.

Headline: ThinkWise: from question to proof in days

Subheadline: A structured pipeline with five phases, expert committees and stage gates ensures every decision is informed, reversible and grounded in reality.

CTA: Start with a Free Friction X‑Ray →

Five Phases in Detail

For each of the five phases, create a section with an icon/illustration and a short description:

Listen (Think & Gather) — Capture context, constraints and goals in a one‑page Executive Brief. This brief becomes the single source of truth for all future stages.

Diagnose (Plan) — Generate multiple options, list their pros, cons, risks and acceptance criteria. Provide a recommended “safe default” and an estimated cost for each.

Prove (Prototype) — Build a prototype or proof‑of‑concept using orchestrations. Show before/after metrics and potential ROI.

Validate (Committee Review) — Expert committees in Market, Product, Data & Finance, Engineering & Ops, and Legal & Compliance sign off on the proof. Their notes and redactions are stored in your Boardroom.

Scale (Ship) — Turn proofs into production‑ready automations and scale across your organisation, always with a reversible path and change log.

Committees of Experts

Heading: Committees of Experts

Paragraph: Every major decision is reviewed by cross‑disciplinary committees. Each seat (Market & Narrative, Product & Strategy, Data & Finance, Engineering & Ops, Legal & Compliance) signs off, providing transparency and authority to every step.

Proof Sprints

Heading: Proof Sprints — Results in 48 Hours

Paragraph: In just two days, our team delivers a working proof aligned with your goal. If we can’t provide a usable proof, you get a full refund. Perfect for testing new ideas or priorities without a long-term commitment.

CTA: Book a Proof Sprint →

Executive Boardroom

Heading: Executive Boardroom

Paragraph: Our Boardroom gives leaders a read‑only, executive‑friendly view of the latest proofs, options and next actions. It eliminates long status meetings and enables fast, informed decisions.
