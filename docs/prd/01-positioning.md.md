# 01 — Positioning

## Purpose
Define the narrative that sells outcomes: remove ghost work (drag) and install the background crew (engine). Aligns hero, Boardroom empty states, and sales collateral.

## Scope
- External messaging for site/app (hero, section intros, CTAs)
- Internal messaging guardrails (voice, promises, proof-first stance)

## Out-of-scope
- Visual design
- Pricing specifics (see 07)
- Technical architecture details (see 06)

## Thesis
Two kinds of ghost work: we **remove** theirs (drag) and **install** ours (engine). From **Busy to Big**.

## Promises (value pillars)
- **Immediate relief:** hours back in week one.
- **Enablement:** one person performs like an elite team.
- **Proof-first:** reversible steps, measurable before/after.
- **Drafts, not surprises:** fast, visible iterations.

## Reasons to believe (RTBs)
- Structured pipeline with stage gates (Think → Plan → Proof → Review → Ship)
- Validator as a first-class step (quality before scale)
- Artifact trail (executive brief, options, proof, validation, changelog)

## Taglines
- From Busy to Big
- Remove the ghost work. Install the background crew.
- Compete like a top team—without hiring one.

## Voice & Tone
- Calm, competent, outcome-focused. Avoid “AI magic” hype. Use verbs: remove, install, ship, prove.

## Inputs → Outputs (artifacts)
- Inputs: brand/company name, audience, primary pain
- Outputs:
  - `positioning/one-pager.md` (narrative + promises + taglines)
  - `positioning/hero-copy.md` (H1, subhead, primary CTA)
  - `positioning/boardroom-empty.md` (exec-friendly microcopy)

## User stories
- As a buyer, I want a plain-English promise so I can decide fast.
- As a founder/exec, I want proof-first language so I feel risk is controlled.
- As a marketer, I want consistent taglines and tone so I can write pages quickly.

## Acceptance criteria
- Hero uses one approved tagline + a plain-English subhead + **Book Friction X-Ray** as the primary CTA.
- Boardroom empty states reference proof-first, reversible steps.
- “Ghost work / background crew” appears at least once above the fold.

## Metrics
- Hero CTR to “Book Friction X-Ray”
- Landing → Boardroom demo view rate
- X-Ray booking conversion

## Risks / Open questions
- Overemphasis on cost-saving vs enablement? (Balance both.)
- Do we localize language by industry segments now or post-MVP?
